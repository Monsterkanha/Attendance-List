# Attendance-List
It creates list of attendees who joined meeting for more than certain period of time.
In this time of highly technology dependent most of meeting are now digital. 
It has both its advantages and disadvantage, students are join the meeting and then leave after sometime, so their attendance get marked.

This is my small contribution, It will only count attendance of student when his/her total time in the meeting is more than set period.

I will further improve this thing. You are more than welcome to find mistakes and contribute to it if you are having some idea.

My future Goal with this project: I want to innovate something that mark attendance with activeness of student for majority of his/her meeting in time.
